# Rwanda Teenage Pregnancy Trends

A Streamlit dashboard visualizing teenage pregnancy trends in Rwanda, based on data from the **Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (Individual Records)** conducted in 1992, 2000, 2005, 2010-2011, 2014-2015, and 2019-2020. These datasets are sourced from the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR).

The dashboard provides an overview of teenage pregnancy trends over time, highlighting changes in rates and patterns. Additionally, it integrates external datasets from the **[DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com/)** website, including data from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania (2022), to demonstrate the compatibility of the dashboard with international data sources.

District boundaries are visualized using GeoJSON data, ensuring precise geographic representation of trends across Rwanda.

# Data Sources for Dashboard

The data used in this dashboard is primarily derived from the **Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (Individual Records)** from the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR). Additionally, external datasets are sourced from the DHS Program website to demonstrate the dashboard's compatibility with data from other countries.

## Microdata Datasets

The following microdata datasets from the **Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (Individual Records)** are used:

- **1992**: [RWANDA - Demographic Health Survey 1992 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/6)
- **2000**: [RWANDA - Demographic Health Survey 2000 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/11)
- **2005**: [RWANDA - Demographic Health Survey 2005 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/14)
- **2010-2011**: [RWANDA - Demographic and Health Survey 2010-2011 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/4/data_dictionary)
- **2014-2015**: [RWANDA - Demographic and Health Survey 2014-2015 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/68/data_dictionary)
- **2019-2020**: [RWANDA - Demographic and Health Survey 2019-2020 (Individual Records)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/98/data_dictionary)

## District Boundaries

The geographic boundaries for Rwanda's districts are included in GeoJSON format, providing accurate district boundaries for mapping:

## External Datasets Used

In addition to the Rwanda datasets, external datasets from the **DHS Program** website are used to showcase the dashboard's flexibility in handling data from other countries. These datasets include:

- **Kenya Standard DHS 2022 data**: [Kenya Standard DHS 2022](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Kenya_Standard-DHS_2022.cfm?flag=1)*Used to demonstrate compatibility with data from Kenya.*
- **Uganda Standard DHS 2016 data**: [Uganda Standard DHS 2016](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Uganda_Standard-DHS_2016.cfm?flag=1)*Used to demonstrate compatibility with data from Uganda.*

1. **Data Extraction**

   - From each dataset, we extracted variables related to year of interview(v007), women's individual sample weight (6 decimals)(v005),respondent's current age (v012),age in 5 years group(v013) stratification for sampling(v023),region (v024),education level(v149),wealth index combined (v190),currently pregnant (v213), living children + current pregnancy (v219),
   - Example: In the 2019-2020 dataset, the "Individual Records (Women)" table was filtered to include only data for women aged 15-19.

#### **Export Data to CSV from Stata (Using GUI)**
